<h1>Offline Investments by Aaron Rader</h1>
<h3>An offline application to keep track of market trades.</h3>

<p>
  I am building this app because every investment tracking software on the market includes various cloud connections 
  and online data storage. I wanted a solution I could keep on my desktop without worrying about the next big 
  corporate hack. Offline Investments does not store any trade or account data online. 100% of your financial data 
  is stored locally on your hard drive.
</p>
<p>
  For now, the data is stored <i>unencrypted</i> in the application installation directory. In the future, I would like
  to implement data encryption and password protection for each account.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I am considering implementing a 
  market price lookup via a market API. This would be the sole use of internet connectivity and no data would be transfered 
  out of the application. This would only be to retrieve current market security data.
